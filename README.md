  Dear Sir/Madam Greetings of the day!
I would like to explain my project based on the assessment given to me to create an expense-sharing application, for creating this web app I have used the languages

python / django framework, HTML, CSS, javascript, and JSON, this application is a fully server-based app. To start the app pls follow the points below:
1) after downloading unzip the app directory and open the app folder in the command prompt (CMD).
 

2) to start the server for the app write and run the command   >>python manage.py runserver 
 

3) here you will get the HTTP link http://127.0.0.1:8000/ 

 

4) open the link in the browser to start the app
 

5) the home page is set to show the list of member names, emails, and phone no.
 

6) here is the navigation bar with the option of :
 

Member =>> Drive to the home page or get the member list here. you can add more members by clicking of add button.
 
Add member button => On hit you will get a form to add the member details there are several checks on email and mob, no. to put proper details like mob. no. must have 10 digits only.
 

note: if you have added a group member that does not mean that they are going to share the expenditure
 
Add Expenditure =>> Here you will get a form to add an expense you need to enter a proper date, expense type or name, expense amount,
and at the last you need to select the member name with comes automatically from your member group and save it
 
Overview =>> After saving each expense save button brings you to this page where you will get all the expenses and details.
On the overview page, three buttons are there.
 

Settle up button =>> By clicking you get the Settlement page.
 

Add Expenses button =>> to add other expenses,
simplify sharing =>> to simplify the result of each member how much will pay or will get from other members.
 

Settlement =>> Here you will get an expense table with the total expense of each member and their settlement amount.
 here is the red button to reset the records by clicking on you need to confirm that and refresh the page
 

note 1: if there are no records the settlement and overview page will give you an error page for no records you click also to go back to the home page.
 

note 2: if any member has not done any expenses but wants to share the expenses you must add in Expenditure with 0 amount and select the member name so they will be listed in the overview for sharing the expense.
 

note 3: if a user is in the member list but not in the overview that means he is not sharing any expenses and will not be in settle amount.
 

note 4: if you want to delete a member or edit their details you need to open the admin panel by setting the username and password the same as "admin" Here you can manage the other details of the group members.
 

 

thanks and regards
